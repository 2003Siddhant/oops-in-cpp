1-> they are attribute of class or class members.
2-> only one copy of the member is created and is shared among all the object
3-> its initialize before any object is created.

useful when wee creates multiple objects and want to have a cnt of them so we can basically create a static member where all the objects will point to them and will get called everytime constructor is called.

we can access static dara member when its in public as its a class member and not object.

when static member is in private mode then we can access it via static function declaration.
