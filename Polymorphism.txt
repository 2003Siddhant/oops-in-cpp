it means many forms -> compile and runtime.

compile : checking during compilation
a) function overloading
b) operator overloading -> complex c3=c1+c2 where c1 and c2 both are objects. here c1 basically calls the function and c2 is passed as an argument.

within the class same type ke objects private data members ko access kr sakte hai like we have accessed real and imag which were private.

Q) why we need default constructor for complex?
- You’re creating a temporary object ans with no arguments.
- That means the compiler looks for a constructor that takes no parameters → the default constructor.
- Without it, the line Compx ans; would fail to compile because the only constructor you had initially was Compx(int r, int i).
