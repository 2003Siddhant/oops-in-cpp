capability of a class to derive property and charactersiticcs ffrom another class.

private data members can only be access inside the class.
public data members can be access inside and outside the class.
public and protected data members can be inherited by the derived class.

protected cant be accessed directly by the class but can be inherited bu the derived class.

if base class has private ,protected and public data members and if we want to inherit it then we can use any access modifier.

if we use public then private and protected will overcome it and the data members will bw pvt and prtd only.

if we use protected then private will overcome it and the data members will bw pvt and public will become prtd only.

if we inherit the prvt members then we have to create a constructor in derived class to use the values.

2)multilevel :=> there will be multiple levels.
Person <- Employee <- Manager

it will work like B inherits A. C inherits B and so on we ccan directly create object of C and have all properties of a,b,c.
