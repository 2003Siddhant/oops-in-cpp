oops in cpp :
we can say classes are user defined datatypes and objects are its variables. 

how to runa file in terminal:
--> this is for compilation->
-:> g++ {filename} -o {any name that i want to give to the executable file}

--> for running:
-:> .\{executable file.exe} .\ represents the curr directory.


object: its an instance of a class. its a real world entity.
while class is not a real world entity.

-> class doesnt have a size while object have a size as it takes memory while class is just a blueprint of how object looks.
